Hello! I'm War, thank you very much for purchasing my asset pack!

I would love to see the project that you'll use my animations on! 
You can send them to my twitter, or instagram, @wars_vault.

If you found the asset pack to your liking, consider leaving a review in the Asset Store!

#################################################################

All spells have an icon, a single sprite sheet and, if necessary, two or more broken down sprite sheets.
Broken down sprite sheets are separated into three portions, those beign: "Start-up", "Active", which are loopable, and "End".

#################################################################

PS: The animations are looping for the sake of the demo, to fix this, sever the last transition on the animator controllers or turn off the "loop" checkbox in the animations themselves
